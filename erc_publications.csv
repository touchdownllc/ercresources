Work-study Financial Aid and Student Outcomes: Evidence from Community Colleges in Texas,Chester Polson & Emily Weisburst,,https://texaserc.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1b-UTA022-Brief-WDQI-5.28.20-REV.pdf,,Policy Brief,,UT Austin,https://texaserc.utexas.edu/about-us/publications/policy-briefs/,,,,,5a,022UTA,WDQI,2014-05,,,"Each year as tuition costs increase, more students rely on financial aid to attend institutions of higher education. Financial aid packages, which are created to encourage individual investments in education, consist of a variety of types of funding assistance and aid packages, and are highly tailored to individual students. In general, financial aid includes need‐ based grants, merit‐based awards, and subsidized loans. A mix of federal, state and local governments, as well as private organizations, finance these programs and many are contingent on student actions or characteristics. The ramifications of the diversity of funding programs within aid packages has received little attention from policy makers. This is unfortunate because certain programs may have behavioral consequences for students beyond decreasing the cost of attendance. For example, federal work‐ study funding provides funds to students conditional on their commitment to working while in school. This job and time requirement may affect student performance in positive or negative ways.","Work-study, work-study funding, student performance",Federal-work study outcomes

More recently, this has moved to include implementation of “exit exams,” which require students statewide to meet a minimum threshold score in addition to completing traditional high school coursework in order to be awarded a diploma.","standardized exam, exit exam, student outcomes",College Readiness
